Who We Are

BigSolve is a non profit organization that seeks to impact lives through partnerships. In line with SDG 17, it is our mission to bring together men of honor and integrity who are dedicated to achieving the goals of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. We have created a platform that will allow us to reach those who are in need of support and guidance. We pursue this mission through education, advocacy and collaboration with others who share these values. 

We believe that while our world faces many challenges, there is also much hope for change if we work together in partnership. 

Our goal is simple: To build a stronger community where every person can live happily with dignity and purpose through collaborations.
